["Background: Cardiovascular diseases account for the highest mortality rate worldwide and are expected to be the major cause of death by 2020 ( 1 ). The time it takes to reach a hospital or a coronary care unit ( CCU ) and the time spent for diagnostic and treatment measures are factors influencing the delay or loss of time from the outset of severe cardiac infarction to the beginning of treatment ( 3 ) .However , with the advancement of the epidemic this social trend reverses and people at lower socioeconomic classes become more vulnerable ( 3 ) . Objectives:the present study aims to examine the inequality of the geographical distribution of CCU beds and cardiologists in Iran using the Gini coefficient and the Lorenz curve . Methods:This study conducted useing demographic data from national census in 2012 collected by the Statistics Center of Iran ( SCI ) . The number of CCU beds and cardiologists in public sector by province in 2012 was obtained from Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education . Finally , in order to calculate Gini coefficient , the demographic data and also the number of CCU beds and cardiologists by province were entered and analyzed through MS Excel software . Results:In 2012 , Iran had a total population of 75 , 149 , 669 with total number of 3665 CCU beds and the total number of 953 cardiologists in public sector. The province of Tehran had the largest percentage of CCU beds ( 23.7% ) and cardiologists ( 17% ) .
