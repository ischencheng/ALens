BACKGROUND	There is a long-held concept among spine surgeons that endoscopic lumbar discectomy procedures are reserved for small-contained disc herniation ; @-year follow-up has not been reported .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study is to assess microendoscopic discectomy ( MED ) in patients with large uncontained lumbar disc herniation ( the antero-posterior diameter of the extruded fragment is @-@ mm or more on axial cuts of MRI ) and report long-term outcome .
METHODS	One hundred eighty-five patients with MED or standard open discectomy underwent follow-up for @ years .
METHODS	Primary ( clinical ) outcomes data included Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) for back and leg symptoms and Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) to quantify pain and disability , respectively .
METHODS	Secondary ( objective ) outcomes data included operative time , blood loss , postoperative analgesics , length of hospital stay , time to return to work , reoperation and complication rate , patient satisfaction index ( PSI ) , and modified ( MacNab ) criteria .
RESULTS	At the end of the follow-up , the leg pain relief was statistically significant for both groups .
RESULTS	NRS back pain , ODI , PSI and MacNab criteria showed significant deterioration for control group .
RESULTS	Secondary outcomes data of MED group were significantly better than the control group .
CONCLUSIONS	Large , uncontained , lumbar disc herniations can be sufficiently removed using MED which is an effective alternative to open discectomy procedures with remarkable long-term outcome .
CONCLUSIONS	Although the neurological outcome of the two procedures is the same , the morbidity of MED is significantly less than open discectomy .
CONCLUSIONS	Maximum benefit can be gained if we adhere to strict selection criteria .
CONCLUSIONS	The optimum indication is single - or multi-level radiculopathy secondary to a single-level , large , uncontained , lumbar disc herniation .
