["Background: Cardiovascular diseases account for the highest mortality rate worldwide. The time it takes to reach a hospital or a coronary care unit ( CCU ) and the time spent for diagnostic and treatment measures are factors influencing the delay or loss of time from the outset of severe cardiac infarction to the beginning of treatment ( 3 ) Objectives: the present study aims to examine the inequality of the geographical distribution of CCU beds and cardiologists in Iran using the Gini coefficient and the Lorenz curve. Methods: This study was conducted using demographic data from the Statistics Center of Iran ( SCI ) and the Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education to calculate the Gini coefficient and was analyzed through MS Excel software. Results: In 2012, Iran had a total population of 75, 149, 669 with a total number of 3665 CCU beds and a total number of 953 cardiologists in the public sector. The province of Tehran had the largest percentage of CCU beds ( 23.7% ) and cardiologists ( 17% ). There were respectively 4.8 and 1.3 CCU beds and cardiologists across the nation per 100, 000. Furthermore, there were 2.6 cardiologists per 10 CCU beds across the country .individuals. The Gini coefficients obtained for CCU beds and cardiologists were 0.129 and 0.045, respectively. Conclusion: Using the Gini measure showed no significant inequality in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in Iran."]
