ALens: An Adaptive Training System for Academic Abstract Writing ANONYMOUS AUTHOR(S) SUBMISSION ID: 1969∗ Novice researchers need to master the art of writing abstracts for their papers, but they often encounter difficulties in this process, as has been well documented <a href="javascript:openDSC(625343245, 3799, '146');" onmouseover="doRollover(101);" onmouseout="undoRollover(101);" id="146" name="101" style="color:#D10A0A" class="#D10A0A"><span class="b-ref">101</span>in the field of higher education<span>. Traditionally, students </span>have<span> been advised </span>to</a> take writing training courses to develop abstract writing skills. However, this process often does not provide students with individual and adaptive feedback on abstract writing. To fill this gap, we first conduct a formative study to derive user requirements for such an abstract writing training tool and propose an adaptive domain-oriented abstract writing training tool, ALens, that uses rhetorical structure parsing to identify main ideas, assesses abstract drafts based on linguistic features, and analyzes writing patterns of the reference abstract through visualization. A comparative user study with an alternative tool for abstract writing training demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. <a href="javascript:openDSC(700072566, 2, '151');" onmouseover="doRollover(104);" onmouseout="undoRollover(104);" id="151" name="104" style="color:brown" class="brown"><span class="b-ref">104</span>CCS Concepts: • Human-centered computing → Human computer interaction (HCI<span>); Visualization; User studies. </span>Additional Key Words and Phrases</a>: <a href="javascript:openDSC(1121677708, 3798, '23');" onmouseover="doRollover(17);" onmouseout="undoRollover(17);" id="23" name="17" style="color:#A85503" class="#A85503"><span class="b-ref">17</span>Educational Applications, Writing Support Systems, Automated Feedback<span>, Summarizing </span>Learning ACM Reference Format</a>: <a href="javascript:openDSC(2289425477, 1, '44');" onmouseover="doRollover(2);" onmouseout="undoRollover(2);" id="44" name="2" style="color:#287B28" class="#287B28"><span class="b-ref">2</span>Anonymous Author(s). 2018<span>.

Basically, the structure of a typical research paper follows a pattern called the “King Model” [29], which delineates the thematic progression of an article through six sections: title, abstract, introduction, body, discussion, and references [29]. Among the major components of an academic paper, the abstract, which usually consists of a separate paragraph outlining the paper’ content [79], has become increasingly important. For example, with the boom in search engines and bibliographic databases, the <a href="javascript:openDSC(337127093, 3797, '161');" onmouseover="doRollover(112);" onmouseout="undoRollover(112);" id="161" name="112" style="color:#795AB9" class="#795AB9"><span class="b-ref">112</span>title and abstract are<span> often </span>the<span> only two </span>parts of a research paper<span> that can </span>be</a> freely viewed by potential readers, while access to the full paper may be subject to charges to the copyright owner [78]. In addition, when researchers conduct systematic investigations of related work, they tend to discard papers with obscure abstracts because reading the full text is too time-consuming for them [3, 79]. In addition, during the blind review process, editors use abstracts to invite appropriate reviewers with expertise in the relevant field to evaluate the paper [3, 78]. However, concerns about the academic abstract writing skills of undergraduate and graduate students in higher education are well documented [23, 33, 77]. From a faculty’s perspective, writing well is more than just following writing conventions. It also involves creative inspiration, problem solving, reflection, and editing, culminating in a complete manuscript [23, 46]. In particular, <a href="javascript:openDSC(469945353, 3796, '28');" onmouseover="doRollover(18);" onmouseout="undoRollover(18);" id="28" name="18" style="color:#cc0066" class="#cc0066"><span class="b-ref">18</span>the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD</a>) has proposed a learning compass that already emphasizes <a href="javascript:openDSC(2778380169, 3783, '174');" onmouseover="doRollover(125);" onmouseout="undoRollover(125);" id="174" name="125" style="color:#B64B01" class="#B64B01"><span class="b-ref">125</span>higher-order thinking skills such as problem solving and</a> reflection as skills needed by further-ready students [34].

To help students develop abstract writing skill typically included in paper writing skills, institutions, such as universities, have conventionally suggested students taking thematic writing training courses, such as scientific paper writing and biology essay writing, during which it is important that individual students receive ongoing formative feedback [15]. However, the need to provide optimal formative feedback on individual abstract writing training in traditional large-scale lectures is often hampered by limited financial and instructional <a href="javascript:openDSC(1107636823, 3796, '12');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="12" name="1" style="color:#D10A0A" class="#D10A0A"><span class="b-ref">1</span>resources []. One possible<span> solution </span>for providing individual feedback is to<span> utilize </span>recent<span> advances </span>in Natural Language Processing<span> (NLP) </span>and Machine learning (ML</a>). We systematically reviewed the literature on abstract writing <a href="javascript:openDSC(763756587, 37, '198');" onmouseover="doRollover(149);" onmouseout="undoRollover(149);" id="198" name="149" style="color:#227967" class="#227967"><span class="b-ref">149</span>in the field of educational technology following</a> the rigorous approach suggested in [87]. However, we found that the existing literature is under-researched in terms of academic abstract writing training []. In contrast, quite a few tools <a href="javascript:openDSC(636449874, 37, '162');" onmouseover="doRollover(113);" onmouseout="undoRollover(113);" id="162" name="113" style="color:#935F32" class="#935F32"><span class="b-ref">113</span>have been developed to<span> enhance </span>the summary writing ability of students</a>. It should be noted that abstracts and summaries are different []. While there are nuances in various accounts of the difference between an abstract and a summary, the general perception is that a summary of an entire article is a more detailed version of an abstract, and that an abstract <a href="javascript:openDSC(1083315180, 3798, '194');" onmouseover="doRollover(145);" onmouseout="undoRollover(145);" id="194" name="145" style="color:#B64B01" class="#B64B01"><span class="b-ref">145</span>is usually written in<span> the order of </span>the<span> content </span>of<span> a </span>research paper</a>, while a summary may focus on important aspects of the article 1. Despite the differences, it has to be acknowledged that both contain important content and require students to have the ability to condense information. We borrow the ideas from studies on summary writing training from which we can conclude that the systems or methods proposed in computer-assisted summary writing training usually involve a cycle of three stages, i.e., reading, writing, and feedback. First, reading and understanding <a href="javascript:openDSC(1641424035, 2909, '75');" onmouseover="doRollover(40);" onmouseout="undoRollover(40);" id="75" name="40" style="color:#336699" class="#336699"><span class="b-ref">40</span>the main idea of the source text is</a> critical. Previous work [76? ] used concept maps to help students identify the main ideas and understand their hierarchical structure. While it may be suitable for general summary writing training, it is not appropriate in the scenario of academic abstract writing training because the concept maps in [76? ] need to be generated by consultants and experts, which is too labor-intensive, especially when it comes to academic papers. In order to annotate concept maps for papers in different fields, a large number of experts are needed, as academic terminology and writing styles vary widely. Even in the same discipline, such as human-computer interaction (HCI), abstracts are written differently due to the different types of papers; for example, an application paper and a survey paper generally have different abstract writing styles. In terms of writing, existing summary training tools provide paradigms and summary strategies to instruct writing, which are good guides for abstract writing training. For the last stage, there are four types of feedback according to literature review, namely: providing scores [22, 26, 39, 88], peer review [92], section content coverage [22, 26, 88] and summary writing strategy detection [1, 26, 43]. However, for the same reasons as concept maps, the coverage of chapter content that requires instructor annotation does not apply to academic writing scenario. To the best of our knowledge, there are no principles and proofs in the current literature on how to design automatically adaptive computer-assisted academic abstract writing tools to help a researcher learn abstract writing styles and patterns in his/her field. To clarify the current status and main concerns of the abstract writing and training process for academic papers, we first systematically reviewed the literature in the field of pedagogy and educational technology [87]. Then, we investigated the pain points of research beginners in writing abstracts through a formative study (a survey of 167 students and semi-structured interviews with 12 students), from which we extracted four major barriers that learners face in writing abstracts, namely: lack of skills in rephrasing content, idea organization, main idea identification, and writing style recognition. First, rephrasing is considered to be one of the core skills for paraphrasing key content, which 1 2 is the essence of abstract writing [9]. However, students, especially L2 (second language) learners, resort to copying sentences from other parts of the paper rather than rewriting the main ideas in their own words [9, 35]. Second, when it comes to the organization of ideas in each sector of the paper, most junior students are not skilled at integrating them in a logical and cohesive manner while making the essay fluent and clear [9]. Third, despite the ability of novice researchers to identify the topic of the essay, secondary and irrelevant information is still easily incorporated, which means that they are deficient in their ability to grasp the complete hierarchy of ideas in the text [23]. Fourth, 73% students mentioned in their interviews that it would have been better to show writing style, or at least give them some hints about it. To address the above issues and fill the gap in abstract writing training, as well as to take advantage of recent advances in NLP technology, we propose a domain-oriented abstract writing training system ALens (short for Abstract Lens), an adaptive learning tool that uses rhetorical structure parsing to identify main ideas, evaluates their abstracts in terms of different linguistic features, and uses visualization to analyze the writing patterns of reference abstracts (i.e., ground truth abstracts). Specifically, to address the first challenge and to train users in their paraphrase abilities, we incorporate linguistic features, such as lexical and syntactic complexity, as assessment metrics. To address the idea organization problem, we ran a re-trained sentence classification model that classifies abstract sentences into five genres (i.e. background, objective, methods, results, and conclusions) [19, 35, 44] and displays the results in different colors. Considering the classification feedback, self-regulation [5] regarding the organization of the abstract will be aroused, which will lead the user to discover which parts of the paper need to be included in specific areas and whether ideas are expressed in a logical and cohesive order. To address the third challenge, we use discourse parsing with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) [40, 58] to construct RST segments from the perspective of identifying logical relations in the introduction. It separates sentence groups into RST trees with phrases on leaf nodes and logical relations on branches. RST uses rhetorical relations (e.g., elaboration, contrast, etc.) to depict the structure and logic of each part of the text [59]. By parsing different paragraphs or the whole introduction, users can get the hierarchical structure of the text at different granularities and grasp the hierarchy of ideas in the text. Finally, to address the last issue, following the approach utilized in the works about attention [11, 75, 84, 85] an attempt is made to find the relevant tokens in the generated abstract <a href="javascript:openDSC(1657789880, 3796, '185');" onmouseover="doRollover(136);" onmouseout="undoRollover(136);" id="185" name="136" style="color:#63009c" class="#63009c"><span class="b-ref">136</span>from the source text<span>, applying semantic similarity </span>to<span> align </span>the ideas<span> between </span>the</a> reference abstract and the source text in an attempt to reconstruct the style used by the authors in writing the reference abstract. In addition, about 27% told us in interviews that they might get stuck in, faced with an empty paper, when they have some ideas to write, and they don’t know where to start. To facilitate the writing of the first draft, we embedded a summarization model into our system [53, 67, 93] as an option to generate an initial draft as a prompt to start. We demonstrate the impact of ALens on users’ abstract writing skills by evaluating our system in a social computing abstract writing training scenario. We quantitatively compared an abstract writing training method with our system. In a user study with 21 students, the results show that with the help of ALens, users can successfully write more accurate abstracts with well-organized content than the alternative tool. In addition, we measured the usability, perceived usefulness, and intention to use of both tools using key constructs [82, 83], and the results were encouraging, suggesting that ALens motivates students to learn abstract writing patterns in their own domain and to write abstracts in an appropriate style. <a href="javascript:openDSC(666085429, 37, '107');" onmouseover="doRollover(64);" onmouseout="undoRollover(64);" id="107" name="64" style="color:brown" class="brown"><span class="b-ref">64</span>In summary, the main contributions of this work are: • We<span> conduct </span>a</a> formative study to understand the problems they encountered in the academic abstract writing process. • We build ALens, an automatic feedback learning tool that first incorporates visualization and interactive features into academic abstract writing training. 3 • We show the effectiveness of ALens by comparing it to an alternative tool for abstract writing training. <a href="javascript:openDSC(763478321, 37, '81');" onmouseover="doRollover(46);" onmouseout="undoRollover(46);" id="81" name="46" style="color:#630000" class="#630000"><span class="b-ref">46</span>2 RELATED WORK Literature that overlaps<span> with </span>this work can be<span> grouped </span>into</a> four categories, technology-mediated summary writing assistance, summary evaluation metrics, NLP models in summarization task, and self-regulated learning. 2.1 Technology-Mediated Summary Writing Assistance We systematically reviewed the literature on abstract writing in the field of educational technology following the rigorous approach suggested in [87]. However, few literature focuses on the development of learning tools for abstract writing, although in the last decade, several tools have been developed to improve students’ summary writing skills. The main difference between an abstract and a summary of a whole article is the length and purpose []. Abstracts usually follow the empirical order of content prescribed by the journal or association and cover the major aspects of the research paper []. Summaries may not follow specific guidelines, emphasizing certain important aspects of the paper and providing more detail than the abstract []. Despite the differences, it has to be acknowledged that both are abbreviated versions of the paper and contain important content which requires the ability to understand, express, synthesize and paraphrase [17, 18, 74]. For example, in studies of computer-assisted summary writing training, concept map [22, 76] arranges the concepts in the text in a hierarchical manner, with general concepts at a shallower level and specific concepts at a deeper level. It attempts to facilitate students’ identification of the main ideas and understanding of the corresponding supporting ideas. Some studies have proposed methods that identify the summarization strategies, including deletion, sentence combination, and paraphrasing used by students to help assess teacher summarization processes and target them during training. Worked examples [22, 39, 88] are exemplars with worked-out steps and predetermined questions <a href="javascript:openDSC(113793979, 3783, '87');" onmouseover="doRollover(49);" onmouseout="undoRollover(49);" id="87" name="49" style="color:#227967" class="#227967"><span class="b-ref">49</span>often used as<span> instruction </span>to help students learn to</a> read the original text and summarization strategies. In addition, by comparing multiple worked examples, students can gain the ability to identify patterns of relevant and irrelevant information [22]. Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) approaches [92] are embedded in the summary writing training system, where students receive peer feedback through online dialogue and interaction. In the process of digesting peer feedback, students reflect on their summarization process and make further revisions [42]. However, the above methods cannot be directly applied to academic abstract writing training. Specifically, concept maps and worked examples are carefully prepared by the tutor, which need to be annotated article by article as the subject matter and progress of the articles vary. In other words, when it comes to academic papers, the workload of instructors in generating concept maps and worked examples will be very high. To fill the gap in abstract writing training and to take advantage of recent advances in NLP technology, we use rhetorical structure parsing to identify main ideas, evaluate abstracts in terms of different linguistic features, and use visualization to analyze the writing patterns of reference abstracts. 2.2 Summary Evaluation Metrics In the learning process, <a href="javascript:openDSC(3083433512, 3788, '187');" onmouseover="doRollover(138);" onmouseout="undoRollover(138);" id="187" name="138" style="color:#cc0066" class="#cc0066"><span class="b-ref">138</span>it is important to provide<span> individual </span>and<span> adaptive </span>feedback<span> [15], and </span>the</a> same is true for abstract writing training. We consider assessment methods widely used in summary writing training as a potential approach to abstract writing training. For example, assessment scores are a typical method for providing formative feedback in computer-assisted abstract writing training [] and there are three kinds of scores, namely content coverage scores [22, 76, 88], scores given by mathematical methods [26, 48, 54, 76, 94] and scores predicted by pre-trained 4 language models [16, 57, 91]. Specifically, content coverage scores are calculated automatically to measure the degree of coverage of each content in the summary. Although calculated automatically, the exact content to be measured is specified by the instructor on an article-by-article basis. However, this is clearly not appropriate for academic abstract writing, as the differences in disciplines, fields, and paper types result in a significant amount of work for faculty to develop content criteria for each type of article. In contrary, mathematical methods and deep learning methods are the most suitable candidates. Although pre-trained deep learning language models can achieve a high degree of agreement with human estimates, their high performance is highly dependent on the availability of relevant datasets. Due to the unavailability of high-quality datasets, we turn to mathematical methods. Specifically, three approaches are commonly used: metrics used in ML [54, 66, 94], latent semantic analysis [52? ] and linguistic features [27, 50, 51]. Metrics in ML, such as ROUGE [54], BERTScore [94] and Bleu [66] and LSA all <a href="javascript:openDSC(774481460, 37, '163');" onmouseover="doRollover(114);" onmouseout="undoRollover(114);" id="163" name="114" style="color:#ce0031" class="#ce0031"><span class="b-ref">114</span>assess the quality of a summary based on<span> semantic overlap with </span>the<span> reference or source </span>text</a>, thus giving an overall score for the summary. However, such single score is not an appropriate feedback [89] to reveal the <a href="javascript:openDSC(1121677708, 3798, '24');" onmouseover="doRollover(17);" onmouseout="undoRollover(17);" id="24" name="17" style="color:#A85503" class="#A85503"><span class="b-ref">17</span>gap between what is understood and what should be understood</a> [71]. Therefore, we rate summary using different scoring criteria (e.g. lexical complexity and cohesion) based on linguistic features, which is considered more appropriate because it captures different aspects of the summary and thus provides more informative and instructive feedback [13]. 2.3 NLP Models in Summarization Tasks The text processing models behind <a href="javascript:openDSC(644995006, 3799, '97');" onmouseover="doRollover(56);" onmouseout="undoRollover(56);" id="97" name="56" style="color:#63009c" class="#63009c"><span class="b-ref">56</span>text summarization<span> tools </span>can be broadly<span> classfied </span>into two<span> categories, namely extraction </span>and<span> abstraction [32]. </span>Extractive</a> approaches [45, 55, 64, 65, 73, 96] copy salient phrases and sentences from the text and merge them to create summaries [65, 96], thus ensuring that the summary <a href="javascript:openDSC(1425266877, 3797, '127');" onmouseover="doRollover(82);" onmouseout="undoRollover(82);" id="127" name="82" style="color:#287B28" class="#287B28"><span class="b-ref">82</span>is factually consistent with the source<span> text [20]. However, </span>the<span> extract paradigm </span>is</a> often criticized for being logically inconsistent with the input text [72, 73]. Abstraction methods [36, 53, 90, 93] rearrange the <a href="javascript:openDSC(775647174, 3160, '182');" onmouseover="doRollover(133);" onmouseout="undoRollover(133);" id="182" name="133" style="color:#935F32" class="#935F32"><span class="b-ref">133</span>language in the text and<span> add new </span>words<span>/phrases </span>to the</a> abstract as needed [37]. Although abstraction methods perform well in generating fluent human-like summaries [93], factual inconsistency [49] and fidelity [61] issues may lead to a heavier cognitive workload. Since there are no advantages or disadvantages of the above two approaches, in our work we embed both types of summarization models into our system [53, 67, 93] as an option to generate an initial manuscript as a prompt for users to start. 2.4 <a href="javascript:openDSC(493167123, 3799, '193');" onmouseover="doRollover(144);" onmouseout="undoRollover(144);" id="193" name="144" style="color:brown" class="brown"><span class="b-ref">144</span>Self-regulated Learning It has been<span> hypothesized </span>that<span> providing students </span>with</a> feedback about their writing abilities will enhance their learning experience and facilitate the writing of high quality summaries []. In order to enable self-regulated learning, providing students with formative feedback as well as setting goals is critical [10]. It has been suggested <a href="javascript:openDSC(589100749, 2209, '176');" onmouseover="doRollover(127);" onmouseout="undoRollover(127);" id="176" name="127" style="color:#0270B6" class="#0270B6"><span class="b-ref">127</span>that in order for feedback<span> systems </span>to be effective<span>, learners must </span>be</a> provided with goals, track their progress, and identify actions to help them achieve those goals [38]. However, individuals are unable to track their own progress during the work [14]. Using targeted assessment and feedback is a good way to enhance the learning process [70]. If feedback on students’ abilities is provided throughout the intervention, it can increase their chances of achieving better short-term outcomes on specific learning tasks [7, 38, 70]. In this work, we provide students with user-centered adaptive feedback on their abstracts to determine whether they could write and improve organized abstracts. 3 FORMATIVE STUDY We <a href="javascript:openDSC(772530079, 3160, '168');" onmouseover="doRollover(119);" onmouseout="undoRollover(119);" id="168" name="119" style="color:#21785B" class="#21785B"><span class="b-ref">119</span>conducted a systematic literature review on<span> abstract writing </span>in the<span> field </span>of</a> educational technology following the rigorous approach suggested in [87]. However, there are few studies on abstract writing training, whereas there are 5 many works about summary writing training. Because of the similarities between summary writing and abstract writing in terms of the writing process and required competencies, we thought we could borrow ideas from these works. To fill the gap in abstract writing training tools, we use a top-down approach, first distilling possible meta-requirements from the existing literature on summary writing training tools. With this goal in mind, we selected 27 papers for meticulous analysis, from which we distilled a closed loop of summary writing learning. In addition, because abstract writing aids span the fields of education, psychology, and computer science, we focused on these streams of literature. <a href="javascript:openDSC(1107636823, 3796, '13');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="13" name="1" style="color:#D10A0A" class="#D10A0A"><span class="b-ref">1</span>On this basis, we selected<span> 32 </span>papers for<span> further </span>analysis</a>. and learned established pedagogical theories in writing [12] and metacognition [56] in the learning process, which is considered a meta-need for an adaptive learning tool. Next to derive user requirements for an academic abstract writing training system, we first need to understand the problems students encounter in the academic writing process. Therefore, we design and examine the following four research questions: 1) RQ1: What are students’ current practices when writing abstracts? 2) RQ2: What are the challenges students have when writing abstracts? 3) RQ3: What kind of support do students need when writing abstracts? and 4) RQ4: What do students want to know about the style of the abstracts? Therefore, a formative survey and follow-up formative interviews were conducted with professors and students who had experience in writing academic abstracts. <a href="javascript:openDSC(763478469, 37, '68');" onmouseover="doRollover(37);" onmouseout="undoRollover(37);" id="68" name="37" style="color:#A85503" class="#A85503"><span class="b-ref">37</span>3.1 Survey Study 3.1.1 Survey Protocol.

For RQ1, we found that most learners (survey: 139/164, interview: 10/11) wrote the abstract after writing the introduction or body of the paper. They usually first determined the structure of the abstract, i.e., what parts needed to be included and which parts were more important. Then, they purposefully wrote about each part. And most learners (survey: 119/164, interview: 8/11) would refer to the introduction or body of the paper to ensure consistency. The detailed <a href="javascript:openDSC(12093753, 37, '165');" onmouseover="doRollover(116);" onmouseout="undoRollover(116);" id="165" name="116" style="color:#63009c" class="#63009c"><span class="b-ref">116</span>results of the<span> survey </span>are shown in Table<span> 1. </span>The main<span> findings </span>of</a> RQ2 – RQ4 are summarized below.

We combined our survey research and interview study to present the following five challenges. C1: Lacking skills in rephrasing content (N=7). Sometimes students tended to rewrite key sentences from the introduction, especially when writing background and conclusion sentences (P1, P3 – P7). However, rephrasing content is sometimes tricky because students cannot use sentences from the introduction directly. Current summarization techniques produce wording that is still too close to the original, which does not help solve this problem. “How to precisely express the same meaning in a new way is sometimes an annoying problem(P2, male, age=24).” C2: Idea organization (N=9). Having a good insight into the logic of the introduction is crucial for students to write excellent abstracts. According to the survey results, most students (82.96%) wrote their abstracts after writing the body of the paper. However, students may forget the logic flow of the introduction after writing the body of the paper. On the other hand, they cannot remember the logic of the instruction well, especially the parts with complex logical relationships. So students need to reread the introduction to recall and reorganize these logical chains, which wastes time. On the other hand, existing abstract generation techniques tend to break the logic chains, which will mislead students and cause additional problems. For example, “in my field, the prior experiments section in the introduction includes too many experimental methods. When writing the abstract, I always need to figure out again how they are related (P9, male, age=21).” C3: Main idea identification (N=8). According to the survey results, almost half of the respondents (47.6%) answered that it was quite difficult to summarize all the key points in a limited space, or to write them concisely enough. C4: Writing pattern and style recognition (N=8). Abstract writing is usually domain-oriented, since different subjects and different types of paper and different journals and conferences generally varies in style and writing 7 pattern. The survey found the 53.0% respondents found that it is time consuming for them to acquire the abstract style by perusing articles in that domain and find the regularity and 65.9% respondents thought it would be better if the regularity is displayed to them. C5: Requirement for a first draft 3 students in formative interview responded <a href="javascript:openDSC(1231155184, 3797, '191');" onmouseover="doRollover(142);" onmouseout="undoRollover(142);" id="191" name="142" style="color:#287B28" class="#287B28"><span class="b-ref">142</span>that they don’t know<span> where </span>to<span> start with writing. “</span>I<span>’m used </span>to</a> making changes based on other people’s draft, and I can’t start with totally blank space (P7, female, age=22).” 3.3.2 Design Requirements. Based on the identified challenges in academic paper abstract writing and user expectations for satisfactory assistance results and comprehensive functionality, we derive the following design requirements of an adaptive abstract writing training tool. R1: Provide assistance on rephrasing. Through formative study, we found that how to rewrite key sentences and other information extracted from the introduction is a big challenge for learners (C1). To solve this problem, we should provide guidance on representing information in another way, such as sentence transformation and phrase substitution based on self-regulated learning theory []. R2: Help <a href="javascript:openDSC(18830981, 3797, '190');" onmouseover="doRollover(141);" onmouseout="undoRollover(141);" id="190" name="141" style="color:#D10A0A" class="#D10A0A"><span class="b-ref">141</span>learners to<span> have </span>a better understanding of the<span> introduction. From </span>the</a> previous formative study, we found that many learners encountered difficulties in selecting core information in a limited space, i.e., the problem of main idea identification (C3). To effectively address this problem, learners’ mastery of the structure and content of the introduction is exceptionally demanding. On the one hand, the introduction is a distillation of the main text, and the relationship between some sentences is difficult to grasp. Therefore, we should provide guidance on identifying the logical relationships of sentences in the introduction. On the other hand, the introduction is long and requires extra time to reread because of forgotten content. We should also help learners to quickly review the structure and content of the introduction. R3: Assist learners in organizing the main ideas distilled from the introduction. Through the formative study, we found that sometimes learners know what needs to be emphasized but have difficulty organizing these key contents fluently (C2). We should help them to have a better understanding of the information from a new perspective and help them to organize the main ideas in a rational way. R4: Assistance in understanding domain-specific abstract style. As shown in Table 1, most participants reported that knowledge of how abstracts are written was very useful to them (Mean = 4.10, SD = 0.88) (C4). The underlying style could guide learners to write abstracts with more accurate content and organization. Therefore, in addition to directly presenting the reference abstract, we should also demonstrate its style in a clear and intuitive manner. R5: Preparation of the first draft version. In the semi-structured interviews, 3 students mentioned the difficulty of writing abstracts from scratch. Despite the relatively low rate, we observed the rise of text summarization platforms such as TLDR this2, Resoomer3, and Wordtune Read4. Therefore, we believe that there is a trend to harness the power of NLP techniques to facilitate abstract writing, for example, to generate the first-edition draft. R6: Easy to access and use. From the survey, some potential users were concerned about <a href="javascript:openDSC(612377288, 3799, '171');" onmouseover="doRollover(122);" onmouseout="undoRollover(122);" id="171" name="122" style="color:#287B28" class="#287B28"><span class="b-ref">122</span>the complexity of the system’s<span> functionality </span>and the<span> difficulty </span>of</a> using it. Therefore, we had to ensure that the tool would not be burdensome and responsive to users, while providing practical features to address the above challenges. For example, users did not need to install additional software or hardware, and we use the typical writing assistance platform interface design 2https://tldrthis.com/ 3https://resoomer.com/en/ 4https://app.wordtune.com/read 8 familiar to learners. In addition, the tool needs to have the fundamental features of a writing aid to ensure effectiveness, such as online revision and basic annotation features. 4 APPROACH OVERVIEW Fig. 1. Pipeline of IntorLens: (1) Generating the first manuscript for later revision; (2) Refining the draft with the consideration of organization, main idea and lexicon; (3)Result evaluation based on semantic analysis. Based on the requirements derived from the formative study, we design an abstract writing training process and incorporate it into a web-based writing assistance platform named ALens. It facilitates users to quickly grasp the main ideas of an essay, optionally write using a summarization model in NLP, recognize their deficiencies in abstract writing, and gain knowledge of the style in a specific scenario. To support the writing process in a convenient and user-friendly manner (R6), visualizations and interactions are integrated into ALens to cater to users’ mental habits and to meet the requirements at different granularities. The front-end interface consists of a Rhetorical Structure View, a Writing Area, an Evaluation Dashboard, and a Reference Abstract with a Flow Map. Figure 1 describes the general stages of the designed abstract training pipeline. First, the user can select an article that needs to be learned for abstract writing and upload it. Subsequently, the rhetorical structure of the original article is analyzed to help the user quickly identify the main ideas in terms of logical structure (R2). Then, the user can choose to write the first draft from scratch or with the help of a summarization model (R5). Considering the lack of content organization, sentences in the abstract are divided into several types (e.g. background and conclusion) [4, 25, 63], and the completeness of the abstract is checked according to the domain of the paper, i.e., whether the rough draft properly covers and arranges the domain typically information needed for the abstract and leads the user to reflect on these issues (R3). At the same time, ALens can automatically analyze the linguistic features of the abstract to check whether it is comprehensible, concise, fluent and consistent with the source text (R1). In addition, paraphrase detection is applied to the feedback to guide the user to rephrase sentences instead of copying them. Finally, users can check the writing style of the reference abstract and analyze its linguistic features and organization. Specifically, a flow map is used to align ideas in the reference abstract with the source text, 9 wwhich <a href="javascript:openDSC(628112170, 37, '166');" onmouseover="doRollover(117);" onmouseout="undoRollover(117);" id="166" name="117" style="color:#A85503" class="#A85503"><span class="b-ref">117</span>is to find the most<span> relevant content </span>from the<span> source </span>text. By<span> comparing these </span>features</a> of different articles with similar academic domain “style”, users are expected to discover writing patterns and learn writing styles (R4). <a href="javascript:openDSC(763478321, 37, '82');" onmouseover="doRollover(46);" onmouseout="undoRollover(46);" id="82" name="46" style="color:#630000" class="#630000"><span class="b-ref">46</span>5 BACK-END ENGINE The back-end engine first</a> parses the article into a rhetorical tree, and then supports the production of an initial manuscript for later revision. The sentences in the abstract are then classified into several genres and evaluated by different linguistic features, providing personal feedback to stimulate revision according to a self-regulated learning theory []. 5.1 Rhetorical Structure Parsing To enable learners to quickly grasp the hierarchical structure of a text and to avoid wasting time by repeatedly reviewing the introduction when writing an abstract, we provide a rhetorical structure parsing for each paragraph. In particular, we provide rhetorical relationship recognition for any text with continuous span, i.e., Sentence 1-5 uninterrupted linear intervals. For example, after inputting a text containing five sentences (S1 – S5), the model can output relations for any continuous text span shown in Figure 2. S4 contrasts with S5, while the text containing S1 – S3 is the background for S4 – S5. All relations and their hierarchical structure build the structure of the whole text and give <a href="javascript:openDSC(773431903, 37, '197');" onmouseover="doRollover(148);" onmouseout="undoRollover(148);" id="197" name="148" style="color:#330099" class="#330099"><span class="b-ref">148</span>a deeper understanding of the text<span> structure. The identification </span>of</a> rhetorical relations consists of two parts: 1) text segmen- background S1 - S3 evidence EDU EDU EDU S1 S2 - S3 S4 - S5 contrast tation and 2) relation identification. For text segmentation, we need to segment the input text into elementary discourse units (EDUs), i.e., tokens of adjacent text spans that are roughly similar to independent phrases. Each sentence consists of several EDUs. We retrained the model proposed by Heilman et al. [40] to operate the segmentation task with high accuracy. The second relation recognition component <a href="javascript:openDSC(911163310, 3793, '192');" onmouseover="doRollover(143);" onmouseout="undoRollover(143);" id="192" name="143" style="color:blue" class="blue"><span class="b-ref">143</span>EDU EDU EDU EDU<span> S4 S5 antithesis </span>EDU EDU EDU EDU</a> S2 S3 was <a href="javascript:openDSC(638221946, 37, '196');" onmouseover="doRollover(147);" onmouseout="undoRollover(147);" id="196" name="147" style="color:#0270B6" class="#0270B6"><span class="b-ref">147</span>modeled as a classification problem<span>, i.e., classifying </span>the<span> relation </span>of</a> two con- Fig. 2.

Therefore, we modified and retrained the ZPar model to predict rhetorical relations between adjacent sentences with more appropriate granularity. 5.2 Construction of NLP Models To accomplish the NLP tasks described above, one can directly use existing pre-trained models. Generic models trained on natural language datasets such as news and emails tend to perform poorly on domain-specific tasks. Abstracts of research papers and their sentence classification are such examples, as there are various abstract and writing styles, which require domain-specific models. 5.2.1 Summarization Model. It is important to note that providing a relatively reliable first draft of the abstract is an important foundation for the later revision process. However, one requirement for developing NLP models <a href="javascript:openDSC(775373755, 37, '180');" onmouseover="doRollover(131);" onmouseout="undoRollover(131);" id="180" name="131" style="color:#006331" class="#006331"><span class="b-ref">131</span>with the<span> 10 </span>ability to<span> summarize </span>research papers<span> is </span>the<span> availability </span>of</a> relevant datasets. We reviewed the literature on corpora and found that the arXiv and PubMed datasets released in [25] met our requirements. PubMed contains 119𝐴 pairs of article bodies and abstracts of biomedical literature, while arXiv contains 203𝐴 pairs of articles on different topics. Since different subjects have different terminologies and writing styles, we decided to construct a subset of arXiv called arXiv-cs that contains only computer science (cs) articles by iterating through the abstracts in arXiv and match them in arXiv-dataset released in [24], which hosts 1.5𝐴 metadata of preprinted articles in Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science from 1991 to 2019 to determine whether they belong to the computer science domain. Based on these two datasets, we developed the following fine-tuning scheme. Since the two datasets belong to the Biomedicine and Computer Science domains, respectively, we developed four summarization models, and for each domain, we developed an extractive model based on BART-base5 [53] and an abstractive model based on T5-large6 [68]. The training parameters follows those described in the original publications and GitHub; in addition, the <a href="javascript:openDSC(441902002, 3796, '42');" onmouseover="doRollover(30);" onmouseout="undoRollover(30);" id="42" name="30" style="color:#CB0099" class="#CB0099"><span class="b-ref">30</span>maximum input<span> token </span>and<span> maximum </span>output token are set to</a> (4096, 512) on PubMed and (16384, 512) on arXiv-cs, and the model performance for both fine-tunings is shown <a href="javascript:openDSC(706330191, 37, '148');" onmouseover="doRollover(102);" onmouseout="undoRollover(102);" id="148" name="102" style="color:#287B28" class="#287B28"><span class="b-ref">102</span>in Table 2.

Results of fine-tuning BART and T5 on two datasets in Biomedicine and Computer Science. In order to provide users with a fine-grained summarization feature, four fine-grained models are not sufficient. What we have mentioned is that the quality of summaization results is highly domain-dependent. Even in a specific domain, if a user tries to summarize <a href="javascript:openDSC(773831313, 37, '181');" onmouseover="doRollover(132);" onmouseout="undoRollover(132);" id="181" name="132" style="color:#795AB9" class="#795AB9"><span class="b-ref">132</span>a part of the<span> source </span>text (e.g., a</a> few paragraphs and sentence groups) using a model <a href="javascript:openDSC(480590305, 3796, '41');" onmouseover="doRollover(29);" onmouseout="undoRollover(29);" id="41" name="29" style="color:#227967" class="#227967"><span class="b-ref">29</span>fine-tuned on a domain-specific corpus, the</a> model does not work well because the output length and input length are shorter than the training data, and the summarization knowledge learned from the whole text <a href="javascript:openDSC(706330191, 37, '149');" onmouseover="doRollover(102);" onmouseout="undoRollover(102);" id="149" name="102" style="color:#287B28" class="#287B28"><span class="b-ref">102</span>cannot be directly applied to the<span> segments </span>of the text</a>, which are derived from the actual practice of our system. Therefore, we use different models for local summarization. We fine-tuned BART-large and T5 on CiteSum [60], which contain small paragraph summaries of citation papers of scientific papers, to simulate the summary scenario of scientific paragraphs in domain-specific research papers. 5.2.2 Sentence Classification Model. To facilitate the organization of the ideas distilled from the source text, we detect the organization in the abstract, thus inducing the user to think about the coverage and arrangement of the content. The organization detection task is considered as a <a href="javascript:openDSC(1107636823, 3796, '14');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="14" name="1" style="color:#D10A0A" class="#D10A0A"><span class="b-ref">1</span>multi-class<span> sentence </span>classification task, where each sentence in the<span> abstract </span>is</a> classified into five types, i.e., background, objectives, methods, results and conclusions []. As for our choice of this classification scheme, the reasons are the absence of domain-specific and annotated sentence classification datasets. For the sentence classification task, we found two datasets, PubMed 200k RCT [28], containing 200𝐴 pairs of type and abstract sentences and CSAbatract [6], containing 2𝐴 pairs corresponding to the Biomedicine and Computer Science domains, <a href="javascript:openDSC(666085429, 37, '108');" onmouseover="doRollover(64);" onmouseout="undoRollover(64);" id="108" name="64" style="color:brown" class="brown"><span class="b-ref">64</span>respectively.

These results show that we can embed our BERT model into our system to provide users with organizational analysis. 5.3 Evaluation Metric As with abstract writing training, it is critical to provide individual and adaptive feedback during the learning process [15]. The summaries and abstracts synthesize the main ideas of the article and require comprehension, expression, synthesis, and paraphrasing abilities [17, 18, 74]. Abstract writing training might benefit from the evaluation methods used in summary writing training. Computer-assisted summary writing training typically provides formative feedback in the form of assessment scores. However, this single score is not an appropriate feedback [89], so we tend to use different <a href="javascript:openDSC(12575453, 3793, '37');" onmouseover="doRollover(25);" onmouseout="undoRollover(25);" id="37" name="25" style="color:#B64B01" class="#B64B01"><span class="b-ref">25</span>7https://github.com/google-research/bert 8https://github.com<span>/google-research/bert </span>9https</a>://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia 12 scoring criteria for scoring abstracts. From the literature [4, 80, 81] and writing instructions on website101112, we concluded that a good abstract should be comprehensible, concise, and fluent. In addition, it should be consistent with the source text and use different words and phrases from the source text. Linguistic features are considered to be more appropriate because it captures different aspects of the abstract and thus provides more informative and instructive feedback [13]. Therefore, we use different linguistic features to calculate the five aspects. First, we selected 21 linguistic features that were shown to be related to the quality of abstracts to calculate their quality based on [26]. Then, we clustered the linguistic features to measure the five aspects of abstracts as shown in Table 3. The weighted sum linguistic features are used to measure these facets, where the coefficients are the corresponding correlations calculated in [26]. 6 FRONT-END VISUALIZATION Fig. 3 Following the design principles mentioned in the formative study, <a href="javascript:openDSC(1121677708, 3798, '25');" onmouseover="doRollover(17);" onmouseout="undoRollover(17);" id="25" name="17" style="color:#A85503" class="#A85503"><span class="b-ref">17</span>we built<span> ALens </span>as a responsive web-based application</a> to demonstrate the academic abstract writing training process.

To represent the hierarchy of ideas, we ini- tially designed the rhetorical structure <a href="javascript:openDSC(220587157, 3793, '40');" onmouseover="doRollover(28);" onmouseout="undoRollover(28);" id="40" name="28" style="color:#330099" class="#330099"><span class="b-ref">28</span>tree, as shown in Figure<span> 4. </span>The leaf nodes</a> are connected to sentences, and the pop-up tooltip contains the name of the relation. However, during the design iteration, users commented that the left side of the tree has a lot of white space and it is too cumbersome to move the mouse over the internal nodes to see the relations. In addition, they criticized that sentences in the article were placed side-by-side and the paragraph structure was broken, resulting in low readability. Therefore, we chose the current design to visually display the relationships and minimize the differences from the original natural text and ensure the readability. The Rhetorical Structure View (Figure 3A) is designed to help the user grasp the hierarchy of ideas and thus quickly identify the main ideas. The rectangles (Figure 3A-a1) at the top of the view indicates the number of respective relations by their lengths. To make the rhetorical relations between sentences more intuitive, these relations are visually encoded with glyphs, as shown in Table 4. Learners can click on these glyphs (Figure 3A-a2) to hide the secondary sentences in a pair of relations. For example, by clicking on the elaboration glyph, all elaborated sentences are preserved and the font color of the supporting sentences is lightened. In this way, learners can quickly capture key information, such as the core sentences in the elaboration relation and the second sentences in a contrast relation, or they can easily check the context by clicking on the glyphs again. Also, we use a flattened Rhetorical Relation Glyph Background Contrast Elaboration Joint Sequence Glyphs of Rhetorical Rela- TABLE 4. tions 6.2 Writing Area The Writing Area (Figure 3B) supports basic edition functions, al- lowing users to write drafts manually or by clicking on the “prompt” button (Figure 3B-b1), which uses the existing summarization model to predict drafts as prompts. Before writing, a suggested abstract writing strategy (??) is provided by clicking on the “Strategies Tips” Fig. 4. Design alternative of rhetorical structure tree. (Figure 3B-b4), enabling novices to quickly start abstract writing. After completing a draft, learners can click on the “Analyze” button (Figure 3B-b2) to analyze the abstract draft in terms of six aspects (one for organizational structure and five for linguistic features). The sentences in the writing areas are classified into five types and highlighted in different colors. At the same time, Figure 3B-b5 provides users with guided steps on how to improve the content and style of their abstracts based on the sentence classification results and the scores of linguistic features. Users can implement feedback by creating new drafts (Figure 3B-b5) to gradually improve the quality of their abstracts. 14 6.3 Evaluation Dashboard The Evaluation Dashboard (Figure 3C) displays evaluation metrics at different granularities. We design the organization map (Figure 3C-c1) as a row of aligned rectangle tiles – the top row represents the organization scheme of the first draft, and the bottom row represents the latest. Each tile in the row represents a sentence in the draft, and its color encodes the type of that sentence. After writing several drafts, users are expected to find the best organization scheme, and they are anticipated to identify the writing style of a group of essays by analyzing the best organization scheme of each paper in the group. In addition to the organization scheme, the line chart (Figure 3C-c2) records the overall score of the serialized drafts, and the five linguistic features are encoded by the radar plot. However, the whole abstract and its scores for the five aspects may confuse learners [89], as they still need to recognize which parts need to be revised and which parts are already good. Therefore, (Figure 3C-c3) provides <a href="javascript:openDSC(232551507, 3788, '195');" onmouseover="doRollover(146);" onmouseout="undoRollover(146);" id="195" name="146" style="color:#630000" class="#630000"><span class="b-ref">146</span>a more fine-grained analysis of the<span> abstract. </span>Each</a> row represents a linguistic aspect, and a set of bars in a bar chart represents the sentences in that draft. In this way, users can identify which sentences and which aspects have not been considered and are poorly written. As a result, they can revise their drafts in a more precise and clear direction. 6.4 Reference Abstract with a Flow Map The Reference Abstract with a Flow Map (Figure 3D&amp;E) are designed to reveal the writing style of the reference abstract. Organization detection is applied to the reference abstract to explicitly reveal its organization scheme. Also, we use a flow map to find the most <a href="javascript:openDSC(536090725, 2909, '106');" onmouseover="doRollover(63);" onmouseout="undoRollover(63);" id="106" name="63" style="color:blue" class="blue"><span class="b-ref">63</span>relevant sentences<span> in </span>the source text for each sentence<span> in </span>the</a> reference abstract. We use the sentence transformer [69] to calculate the semantic similarity score of <a href="javascript:openDSC(763103189, 37, '164');" onmouseover="doRollover(115);" onmouseout="undoRollover(115);" id="164" name="115" style="color:#866712" class="#866712"><span class="b-ref">115</span>each sentence in the<span> source text to </span>each sentence in the reference<span> abstract. </span>The</a> square tiles on each side represent a sentence from the source text or the reference. The color depth of each tile on the abstract side is computed by averaging the first 𝐴 similarity scores, where 𝐴 can be specified by the user. And the tiles on the source text side represent the similarity score when the user’s mouse is placed over a sentence in the abstract. Meanwhile, the top 𝐴 similar <a href="javascript:openDSC(3267434892, 3791, '63');" onmouseover="doRollover(35);" onmouseout="undoRollover(35);" id="63" name="35" style="color:#866712" class="#866712"><span class="b-ref">35</span>sentences in the source text<span> are highlighted </span>and<span> linked to sentences </span>in the</a> reference. In this way, users can explore the writing patterns of the reference abstract. For example, they may find that the sentence in the reference abstract that describes the background may come from the end of the paragraph introducing the background <a href="javascript:openDSC(625343245, 3799, '147');" onmouseover="doRollover(101);" onmouseout="undoRollover(101);" id="147" name="101" style="color:#D10A0A" class="#D10A0A"><span class="b-ref">101</span>in the<span> source </span>text<span>.

Anker comes from the Department of Biomedical Engineering and has been starting his research career for about four months. Prior to using ALens, he had no experience writing academic abstracts for journals and conferences, but he did have experience writing abstracts for course essays. We chose a paper from biomedical science and gave him training in writing academic abstracts in a related field. First, he uploaded a prepared text file, and then the article was parsed into a rhetorical tree. We observed that he began to consciously select sentences as he read the article, 15 explaining “as far as I know, a typical abstract should introduce the purpose of the work, what problems it is trying to solve, the research methods used and the conclusions”, and then he created a new tab to parse the copied sentences and clicked the “Analyze” button. From the conciseness and comprehensibility indicators (Figure 5) in the evaluation dashboard (Figure 3C-c3), he found that his second draft was not easy to understand and not concise enough, mainly because of the last three sentences. In addition, he found that the last three sentence were too long to read, so he broke them into shorter sentences, added some connectives, and then clicked the “Analyze” button. The result of the analysis showed that the sentences in his draft were more concise and easier to read. He then decided to look at the reference abstract. To his surprise, he found that he had missed the experimental results from the organization history viewFigure 5. He said, “this is the first time I know that the experimental results needed to be independent of the conclusions, which I previously thought already contained the results.” Anker concluded with a quick review of the results section of the paper, grasping the description of the combined results under the auxiliary rhetorical relations from the lengthy description of the results. 7.2 User Study Alternative Training SystemTo evaluate ALens, we built a baseline system as shown in Figure ??, We design the baseline to simulate the traditional way of abstract writing and to control the similarities and differences between ALens and the baseline. The baseline supports read- ing the article and writing abstract. We follow the practice of previous summary writing system [39, 88] to provide an overall score of abstract to users as a feedback. The keep ALens and the baseline system consistent with each other, both of them follow the same abstract writing and shares many functions. First, both the tools have the “Strategies Tips” button to learn general abstract writing strategies. Furthermore, the new draft button is also implemented to facilitate the abstract iteration process. The “ Show Reference “ which will disappear when the click it and be present after click the ” New Draft “ button. Researches about the self-regulated learning theory suggests that indi- Fig. 5. (a) The understandability of each sen- vidual feedback can help them learn better [10]. During a learning process, tence for the three analyzed drafts and the results for the reference are on the self-reflection is important for effective learning which can trigger the leftmost side. (b)The conciseness of each creation of new knowledge through self-regulated learning [98]. Also, sentence for the three analyzed drafts writing, as a creation process, highly depends on the engagement [41]. [41] and the results for the reference are on the leftmost side. Relatively short bars suggests that students can write text in a more cohesive manner when means sentences are relatively concise. they are concentrated and engaged in the writing process. Therefore, we (c) The content organization history of make the following hypotheses: the three analyzed draft and the organi- zation of the reference. • H1: In comparison to the baseline system, individual feedback help users write abstracts with more appropriate style. The style here is defined by content organization and language style. • H2: In comparison to the baseline system, ALens is useful to help users construct knowledge of academic abstract writing. 16 • H3: In comparison to the baseline system, ALens increases the users’ satisfaction level with the final draft of the abstract. • H4: In comparison to the baseline system, ALens enables users to be more engaged in the writing process. To test our hypotheses, we designed a laboratory experiment where participants are required to read and comprehend the given introduction of an article in computer science, write an abstract according to the introduction, learn the writing style of the reference abstract and revise their manuscript at least once. Because academic abstract writing is highly dependent with the domain and students out of the domain usually encounter barriers in reading and comprehending the article, we recruited 21 students from the computer science department in our university through social network. Our <a href="javascript:openDSC(1107636823, 3796, '15');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="15" name="1" style="color:#D10A0A" class="#D10A0A"><span class="b-ref">1</span>participants were randomly assigned<span> in the experimental </span>and control<span> groups. </span>The<span> experimental </span>group used<span> ALens, </span>while participants in the control group used the</a> baseline system. After random assignment there are 12 <a href="javascript:openDSC(1335839263, 3722, '160');" onmouseover="doRollover(111);" onmouseout="undoRollover(111);" id="160" name="111" style="color:#006331" class="#006331"><span class="b-ref">111</span>students in the experimental group and<span> 9 students </span>in the control group<span>. We invited them </span>to</a> come to our laboratory and to do the experiment on our devices which are exactly the same. Participants of the experimental group (9 males and 3 females) had an average age of 21.17 (SD=1.64) and they had experienced writing academic abstract 0.33 (SD=0.65) times on average. In the control group, there were 7 males and 2 females. They are average age was 20.89(SD=1.54) and they had written academic abstract for 0.22 (SD=0.67) times on average. 7.2.1 Design and Procedure. We designed an ex- periment with three stages namely, a pre-test stage, a short-term abstract writing <a href="javascript:openDSC(771717666, 37, '183');" onmouseover="doRollover(134);" onmouseout="undoRollover(134);" id="183" name="134" style="color:#ce0031" class="#ce0031"><span class="b-ref">134</span>training stage and<span> a </span>post-test stage<span>. In the training </span>stage, the</a> experimental group used ALens and the the con- trol group used the alternative baseline system to read, write and learn. Pre-test stage: To test whether our initial ran- dom grouping result in a real randomized group- ing, we first test our participants from the accep- tance to new information technology, feedback seeking, self-confidence and ability of academic abstract writing through a pre-survey with 16 questions. First, we asked four questions about the acceptance to new information technology of participants referring to the methods in [2]. Sec- ond, we asked them questions about the ability to to proactively seek feedback according to [8]. Meanwhile, following [8], we also test their self- confidence which aim to control the condition of Mental abilities. Fourth, we test their ability of writing academic abstract by asking their experi- ence in academic abstract writing. Fig. 6. The baseline system supports users reading the article, write the abstract and inspect the reference. Baseline can provide an overall score on the quality of the abstract 17 Short-Term abstract writing training stage: Before the stage started, we provided a brief introduction about the usage of our system and let them play with respective system for about 5 minutes. To test whether our system enable users construct the knowledge about academic abstract writing, we develop a short-term abstract writing training stage as follows. First, participants were asked to read an introduction of computer science paper from <a href="javascript:openDSC(1854356602, 3797, '189');" onmouseover="doRollover(140);" onmouseout="undoRollover(140);" id="189" name="140" style="color:#336699" class="#336699"><span class="b-ref">140</span>IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG</a>) since introductions in TVCG usually contains whole information of the article. Our co-author, an experts in the domain of visualization confirmed this fact. They are required to spend at least 5 minutes reading the introduction of about 800 words to ensure that they had a basic comprehension of the article. Then they are asked to spend at least 10 minutes writing the abstract. Subsequently, users can inspect the reference abstract and learn the writing style of that abstract for at least 5 minutes. Then experimental group was using ALens to check the organization of the abstract and the locations of core sentences while students in the control group can analyze the abstract based on their knowledge. Then they are required to revised their first draft based on the writing knowledge learned from the reference abstract and according to the evaluation metrics if their are in the experiment group. Finally, they could progressively embellish the abstract until they were satisfied with the draft. All the drafts during the training process were collected by both systems and sent to later assessment. Post- test stage: In this stage, we first measure user’s intention to use our system, usability and usefulness of our system following the technology acceptance test [86]. In addition, we measure users’ satisfaction level about their first draft and last draft both group and measure the perceived engagement since writing is creation process where engagement is an important component [41]. Example items for the five constructs are : "If the system is released, I will use the system to train abstract writing","I can write abstract with appropriate style.","I feel like I can learn to use the system quickly","I am satisfied with the first draft written using the system ,"I was focusing on writing itself, time passed quickly for me" We use <a href="javascript:openDSC(1107636823, 3796, '16');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="16" name="1" style="color:#D10A0A" class="#D10A0A"><span class="b-ref">1</span>a 1- to<span> 7-</span>point Likert scale<span> (7: </span>very sure<span>, 1:</span>not very sure, with<span> 4 </span>being a neutral statement</a>) for participants to assess. 7.2.2 Measurement of Abstract Quality. Technology acceptance, Users’ satisfaction level and engagement were used to evaluated the system from the subject perspective of users and test the hypotheses H3 and H4. In addition, we test the hypotheses H1 and H2 by measuring the quality of abstracts from both group. We measured the quality of the drafts from two aspects; 1)the perceived quality and 2) the formal quality. Perceived quality: Since we adopt as paper in the domain of visualization as a training material for user study, we invite two senior graduate students in that domain to help us assess the abstract on 1- to 7-point Likert scale (7: very good, 1:very bad). Both of them has an research experience of 3 years. Our goal was to subjectively judge the quality of the abstract leveraging the reading experience of experts in that domain. We take the average their <a href="javascript:openDSC(542970641, 3793, '39');" onmouseover="doRollover(27);" onmouseout="undoRollover(27);" id="39" name="27" style="color:#0270B6" class="#0270B6"><span class="b-ref">27</span>scores as the final score of the<span> draft. Formal quality: </span>We<span> analyze </span>the</a> first drafts and the last drafts for formal quality. We define formal quality of an abstract as following seven aspects: content completeness, content arrangement, understansdability, consistency, fluency, diversity and conciseness. As we have mentioned before, the seven aspects are refined from a bunch of articles and course websites. First, we create a criterion in terms of the seven aspects on 1- to 7-point Likert scale (7: very good, 1:very bad). We annotated the 42 drafts by ourselves and take the average our scores as the final score of the draft on that aspects. 18 Pre-test Stage Group New technology acceptance Self- Feedback confidence seeking Times for writing abstract Mean ALens 5.83 5.42 5.25 0.33 Mean Baseline 5.89 5.33 5.00 0.22 SD ALens 0.58 0.90 0.87 0.65 SD Baseline 0.60 0.87 1.00 0.67 Double-sided t -0.21 0.21 0.60 0.38 p-Value 0.834 0.833 0.557 0.707 Training Stage Group First Draft Formal quality First Draft Perceived quality Second Draft Formal quality Second Draft Perceived quality Mean ALens 4.08 4.50 5.39 5.58 Mean Baseline 4.22 4.44 4.56 4.78 SD ALens 0.74 0.90 0.99 0.79 SD Baseline 1.15 0.73 0.74 0.67 Double-sided t -0.32 0.16 2.22 2.52 p-Value 0.757 0.878 0.039 0.021 Post-test Stage Group Technology acceptance First Draft Satisfaction Seconda Draft Satisfaction Engagemnt Knowledge Construction Mean ALens 4.76 3.50 5.33 4.33 5.33 Mean Baseline 3.78 3.67 4.67 4.44 3.78 SD ALens 0.68 1.09 0.49 0.49 0.98 SD Baseline 0.69 0.71 0.71 0.53 0.67 Double-sided t 3.24 -0.42 2.42 -0.49 4.31 p-Value BLE 5.

To ensure our random assignment is successful and control the potential effects of the small sample size, we compared the difference of both group from the four aspects as shown in the pre-test stage in Table 5. The p value for the four constructs are all larger <a href="javascript:openDSC(117505122, 3783, '159');" onmouseover="doRollover(110);" onmouseout="undoRollover(110);" id="159" name="110" style="color:#CB0099" class="#CB0099"><span class="b-ref">110</span>than 0.05<span> which guarantees </span>there<span> are </span>no significant difference between<span> both </span>groups in<span> terms </span>of</a> these four constructs. Technology acceptance To compare the technology acceptance, we average the Likert score of perceived usefulness, intention to use and the usability. From the column of technology acceptance, we can find the that ALens received higher acceptance than the baseline system. Technology acceptance for learning tools is a critical base for users to make further learning on it. The positive technology acceptance provide a <a href="javascript:openDSC(1107636823, 3796, '17');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="17" name="1" style="color:#D10A0A" class="#D10A0A"><span class="b-ref">1</span>promising results to use this tool as<span> an adaptive feddback </span>application</a>. Writing with more appropriate styleTo test whether users write abstracts with more appropriate style, we collected 42 drafts of abstracts written by participants and evaluated their formal quality and perceived quality. From Table 5, we can see that there is no significance between the first drafts in two groups. However, <a href="javascript:openDSC(494458529, 1840, '177');" onmouseover="doRollover(128);" onmouseout="undoRollover(128);" id="177" name="128" style="color:#330099" class="#330099"><span class="b-ref">128</span>there is statistically difference between the<span> second draft </span>of two groups</a>, which demonstrate the effectiveness of ALens to train users to write abstracts with more appropriate style. Thus H1 is accepted. 19 Abstract writing knowledge construction To test whether users whether acquire some knowledge, we asked them three quantitative problems and one qualitative problem. Both results Table 5 shows the promising results that users can acquire some knowledge about abstract writing. Thus H2 is accepted. Increased satisfaction level The results in post-test stage shows that both ALens and alternative tools enable users to increase the satisfaction level about their drafts. Such is human nature that iteration usually makes things better. However, the difference of satisfaction levels between two groups becomes more significant on the second draft which means that ALens can greatly increase their satisfaction level. Thus H3 is accepted. Higher engagement in the writing process The statistic results shows that there is no significance between the two groups in terms of engagement. Thus H4 is rejected. We think that users my feel distracted during the long reading and writing process and the interaction time for learning the writing style and analyze their draft is relatively shorter. Qualitative feedback <a href="javascript:openDSC(1107636823, 3796, '18');" onmouseover="doRollover(1);" onmouseout="undoRollover(1);" id="18" name="1" style="color:#D10A0A" class="#D10A0A"><span class="b-ref">1</span>We also included open questions in our survey to receive</a> some improvement suggestions. For example, we asked which part of the system is needed to be improvedWhy? Overall. most of them hold positive attitude to ALens, in particular, the flow map, the evaluation at sentence level, “ Strategies Tips“, the sentence classification function and the ”Prompt” function. However, some participant also give constructive suggestions. Generally, they complain about the mislead caused by rhetorical tree, the wrong sentence classification results and the confused score in evaluation deshboard. 9 DISCUSSION AND LIMITATION Our user study shows that the adaptive formative feedback on students’ abstract draft helps them t write abstracts with more appropriate style including content organization and language style, We verify this from both the formal quality and the perceived quality compared to the alternative tools. The last drafts in both groups are of higher quality than the initial one. We believe that the self-regulated learning theory can explain this effect. However, when comparing the quality level between two groups of the same draft, we found the difference between the drafts in the same batch increases significantly. It is important to keep in mind that the right portion and granularity of feedback is important for learners to absorb and self-regulate [10]. In comparison to the alternative tool, ALens provide different levels of individual feedback thus motivate students to change behavior. The proven short-term progression on academic abstract writing in the user study indicates that self-regulation motivates participants to learn the writing style and construct relevant knowledge. In addition, to make our research successfully applied to the actual abstract writing training scenario, we verify the technology acceptance of our system which provides promising results. <a href="javascript:openDSC(469945530, 3796, '29');" onmouseover="doRollover(19);" onmouseout="undoRollover(19);" id="29" name="19" style="color:#21785B" class="#21785B"><span class="b-ref">19</span>Hence, our work<span> has </span>several contributions to current research</a>.

We will follow the methods describe in [47], first train our RST parser on automatic annotated <a href="javascript:openDSC(4028922774, 3797, '11');" onmouseover="doRollover(16);" onmouseout="undoRollover(16);" id="11" name="16" style="color:#63009c" class="#63009c"><span class="b-ref">16</span>data and fine tune it on RST-DT</a> [21]. To improve the accuracy of sentence classification, we will use 20 a similar Data Augmentation methods. We first train our bert model on a automatic annotated data and then tuned on domain-specific dataset. In terms of the confused score in evaluation dashboard, we want to improve the understanding of the scores by providing annotated paradigms and explanations to clarify the underlying meaning of the score and compile the the action step guidelines to achieve a higher score. In addition, we consider to try transformer-based models to predict more accurate scores. In the user study, we verify the short-term positive impact of ALens on participants’ academic abstract writing. However, the long-term learning effects are still needed to be verified. Therefore, we decide to conduct a field experiment to test the effectiveness and acceptance. We set up two groups and the <a href="javascript:openDSC(763433485, 37, '178');" onmouseover="doRollover(129);" onmouseout="undoRollover(129);" id="178" name="129" style="color:#227967" class="#227967"><span class="b-ref">129</span>control group that<span> will </span>not receive any feedback<span> except </span>the</a> guidance from their supervisors and the experimental group that will receive feedbackk from both their supervisors and ALens. Finally, an evaluated adaptive learning tool is anticipated to be forwarded for research novices to practice academic abstract writing. 10 CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK REFERENCES [1] <a href="javascript:openDSC(908778133, 3791, '128');" onmouseover="doRollover(83);" onmouseout="undoRollover(83);" id="128" name="83" style="color:blue" class="blue"><span class="b-ref">83</span>Asad Abdi, Norisma Idris, Rasim M Alguliyev<span>, and </span>Ramiz M Aliguliyev. 2016.
