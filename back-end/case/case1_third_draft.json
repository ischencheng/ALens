["In Iran, unequal access to health services is one of the controversial issues. The present study aims to examine the inequality of the geographical distribution of CCU beds and cardiologists in Iran using the Gini coefficient and the Lorenz curve thus, measuring the equality of health services. This study was conducted using statistical data from the Statistics Center of Iran ( SCI ) and the Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education. In the present study among various possible inequality measures,  preference was given to the Gini coefficient. In order to calculate the Gini coefficient, the demographic data and also the number of CCU beds and cardiologists by province were entered and analyzed through MS Excel software. The proportions of CCU beds and cardiologists per 100,000 population were 4,88 and 1,27, respectively; also the Gini coefficients were 0,129 and 0,045, respectively. Although statistics showed a skewness in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in Iran, the Gini measure showed that there is no significant inequality in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in Iran. Moreover, even the equal distribution of cardiovascular health facilities such as CCU beds , does not mean they are sufficiently provided in Iran ."]
