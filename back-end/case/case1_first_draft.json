["Cardiovascular diseases account for the highest mortality rate worldwide and are expected to be the major cause of death by 2020 ( 1 ). Limited and unequal access to health services in Iran is one of the controversial issues mentioned in several studies ( 5-7 ).

Since accessibility to intensive healthcare, in particular for cardiovascular conditions, is of utmost importance and since the appropriate distribution of coronary care unit ( CCU ) beds and cardiologists can be taken as a measure, the present study aims to examine the inequality of the geographical distribution of CCU beds and cardiologists in Iran using the Gini coefficient and the Lorenz curve.

This study was conducted using demographic data from the national census in 2012 collected by the Statistics Center of Iran ( SCI ). The number of CCU beds and cardiologists in the public sector in the province in 2012 was obtained from the Iran Ministry of Health and Medical Education. In the present study among various possible inequality measures ( such as Gini coefficient, decile ratio, Robin Hood index, and Atkinson index ) preference was given to the Gini coefficient. in order to calculate the Gini coefficient, the demographic data and also the number of CCU beds and cardiologists by province were entered and analyzed through MS Excel software.

Using the Gini measure showed that there is no significant inequality in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in Iran. Nevertheless , our descriptive statistics showed that there is a skewness in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in Iran . Moreover, even the equal distribution of cardiovascular health facilities such as CCU beds , does not mean they are sufficiently provided in Iran ."]
