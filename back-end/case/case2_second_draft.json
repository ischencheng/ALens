["It's long been believed by spine surgeons that endoscopic lumbar discectomy is only for small-contained disc herniations; no follow-up has been reported after a year. On axial cuts of MRI, the extruded fragment has an anteroposterior diameter of 6-12 mm or more. MED is being tested in patients with uncontained lumbar disc herniation. One hundred eighty-five patients with MED or standard open discectomy were followed for years. For back and leg symptoms, the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was used, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used to measure pain and disability. Secondary outcomes included patients' satisfaction (PSI), blood loss, postoperative analgesics, hospital stay, return to work, reoperation and complication rate, and modified (MacNab) criteria. The MED procedure is an effective alternative to open discectomy for large, uncontained lumbar disc herniations. Both procedures have similar neurological outcomes, but MED has a lower morbidity rate. We can get the most benefit if we stick to strict selection criteria. Radiculopathy secondary to a single-level, large, uncontained lumbar disc herniation is the best indication."]
